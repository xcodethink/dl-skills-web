description: Use when receiving code review feedback, completing tasks requiring review, or before making any completion/success claims. Covers receiving feedback with technical rigor, requesting reviews via code-reviewer subagent, and verification gates requiring evidence before status claims.

# Code Review

## Overview

Guide proper code review practices emphasizing technical rigor, evidence-based claims, and verification over performative responses. Code review requires three distinct practices: receiving feedback with technical evaluation, requesting systematic reviews, and enforcing verification gates before any completion claims.

## Core Principle

**Technical correctness over social comfort.** Verify before implementing. Ask before assuming. Evidence before claims.

## When to Use This Skill

### Receiving Feedback

Trigger when:
- Receiving code review comments from any source
- Feedback seems unclear or technically questionable
- Multiple review items need prioritization
- External reviewer lacks full context
- Suggestion conflicts with existing decisions

### Requesting Review

Trigger when:
- Completing tasks in subagent-driven development (after EACH task)
- Finishing major features or refactors
- Before merging to main branch
- Stuck and need fresh perspective
- After fixing complex bugs

### Verification Gates

Trigger when:
- About to claim tests pass, build succeeds, or work is complete
- Before committing, pushing, or creating PRs
- Moving to next task
- Any statement suggesting success/completion
- Expressing satisfaction with work

## Quick Decision Tree

```
SITUATION?
|
+-- Received feedback
|   +-- Unclear items? -> STOP, ask for clarification first
|   +-- From partner? -> Understand, then implement
|   +-- From external reviewer? -> Verify technically before implementing
|
+-- Completed work
|   +-- Major feature/task? -> Request code-reviewer subagent review
|   +-- Before merge? -> Request code-reviewer subagent review
|
+-- About to claim status
    +-- Have fresh verification? -> State claim WITH evidence
    +-- No fresh verification? -> RUN verification command first
```

## Receiving Feedback Protocol

### Response Pattern

READ -> UNDERSTAND -> VERIFY -> EVALUATE -> RESPOND -> IMPLEMENT

### Key Rules

- No performative agreement: "You're absolutely right!", "Great point!", "Thanks for [anything]"
- No implementation before verification
- DO: Restate requirement, ask questions, push back with technical reasoning, or just start working
- If unclear: STOP and ask for clarification on ALL unclear items first
- YAGNI check: grep for usage before implementing suggested "proper" features

### Source Handling

- **Partner:** Trusted - implement after understanding, no performative agreement
- **External reviewers:** Verify technically correct, check for breakage, push back if wrong

## Requesting Review Protocol

### When to Request

- After each task in subagent-driven development
- After major feature completion
- Before merge to main

### Process

1. Get git SHAs: `BASE_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD~1)` and `HEAD_SHA=$(git rev-parse HEAD)`
2. Dispatch code-reviewer subagent via Task tool with: WHAT_WAS_IMPLEMENTED, PLAN_OR_REQUIREMENTS, BASE_SHA, HEAD_SHA, DESCRIPTION
3. Act on feedback: Fix Critical immediately, Important before proceeding, note Minor for later

## Verification Gates Protocol

### The Iron Law

**NO COMPLETION CLAIMS WITHOUT FRESH VERIFICATION EVIDENCE**

### Gate Function

IDENTIFY command -> RUN full command -> READ output -> VERIFY confirms claim -> THEN claim

Skip any step = lying, not verifying

### Requirements

- Tests pass: Test output shows 0 failures
- Build succeeds: Build command exit 0
- Bug fixed: Test original symptom passes
- Requirements met: Line-by-line checklist verified

### Red Flags - STOP

Using "should"/"probably"/"seems to", expressing satisfaction before verification, committing without verification, trusting agent reports, ANY wording implying success without running verification

## Integration with Workflows

- **Subagent-Driven:** Review after EACH task, verify before moving to next
- **Pull Requests:** Verify tests pass, request code-reviewer review before merge
- **General:** Apply verification gates before any status claims, push back on invalid feedback

## Bottom Line

1. Technical rigor over social performance - No performative agreement
2. Systematic review processes - Use code-reviewer subagent
3. Evidence before claims - Verification gates always

Verify. Question. Then implement. Evidence. Then claim.
